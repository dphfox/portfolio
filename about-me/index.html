            <p>
                I'm a software engineer and UI/UX designer. I have related
				interests in game development, motion design, typography,
				iconography, music, sound design, and computer graphics.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm interested in building immersive, engaging virtual worlds
				for audiences worldwide, from cinematic game universes to casual
				social spaces.
				To date, my work has been enjoyed by <strong>millions of
				people</strong> around the world.
            </p>

            <p>
                I come from <strong>London, England</strong>. In my teens, I was inspired to build games
                using Roblox and Minecraft, and later experimented with Source engine mapping.
            </p>
            <p>
                I now develop open-source libraries, independently build plugins & tools for game creators, experiment
				with crafting virtual worlds, and create videos talking about Roblox, virtual worlds, and the process of
				creating them.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hold a First-Class Honours degree in BSc Computing Sciences from the University of East Anglia, taken
                to study computer graphics and light transport.
            </p>
            <h3>Tools I use</h3>
            <p>
                I've used <strong>Roblox</strong> since 2008. Nowadays, I also occasionally use
                <strong>Godot</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Figma</strong> is my tool of choice for UI design, vector editing and mock-ups.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Blender</strong> is my 3D modelling workhorse.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Ableton Live 11 Suite</strong> is my digital audio workstation.
            </p>
            <p>
                I use <strong>paint.net</strong> as a minimal & effective raster image editor.
            </p>
            <h3>Programming languages & packages</h3>
            <p>
                I professionally script in <strong>Luau</strong>. I previously used <strong>JavaScript</strong> with
                <strong>Node.js</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                My systems work is confidently in <strong>Rust</strong>. I've also built a few things with
                <strong>C/C++</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>wgpu</strong> is my go-to for GPU work. I know some <strong>Vulkan</strong> too.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm fluent and natural in <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>HTML</strong> - hopefully you can tell!
            </p>
